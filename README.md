# Fiesta Market

A website for buying and selling items for the MMORPG Fiesta Online - my senior project.

## Description

Fiesta Market is a React web app that enables players of the MMORPG Fiesta Online to coordinate the buying and selling of in-game items outside of the game. The current system requires players to set up a shop in-game and leave the game client open while vending their items. This system has multiple flaws including that the players must leave the game running for long periods of time as well as there is no good way to take offers on items - if you leave it up to potential buyers to message you, you may disconnect from the server while “AFK” and never see the offer messages.

I chose this project because I felt that it would provide a challenge while being something fun that solves a problem that I myself have had to deal with. By choosing to create a web app, I did have some advantage in having taken courses in client and server-side development, experience working with DigitalOcean, and creating a Wordpress site from the ground up. However, one of the major factors in my choice of this project was the opportunity to work with the React framework, which I went into this project with zero experience with. This project also required creating a website with an API backend, user accounts, authentication, and user roles from the ground up - something I had not done before.

Ultimately, the goal with this project was to get something as close to full-featured as possible and that relieves some of the biggest pains points of selling and buying items for Fiesta Online.
